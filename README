* Notes *
The authentication backend is in progress.  There are a few things that need to be improved
including signing for security purposes, and a few additions to the user workflow.
This code only implements the one click login process.  Ideally something should be done which
includes some additional info.  For your own project, you can take the data stored in the 
profile model and hook that in either to your AUTH_PROFILE module

* Installation *

1. sudo python setup.py install
2. copy over the templates

have a look at the login template - you will need to provide the blocks it expects
in the file it inherits from

3. Update your settings file to include GIGYAUTH_API_KEYS=<your gigya api key>
   and GIGYAUTH_LOGIN_FAILURE_PAGE = page to fall back on when the authentication should fail
